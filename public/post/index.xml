      <description>Thanks, your package is on its way to CRAN.
 Introduction I am really excited to announce (12 days late) that lisa is on CRAN, my first R package available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network! This was a pretty big deal for me because I have wanted to submit something to CRAN for a couple of years now.
Anyway, lisa is a color palette pacakge, it provides R users with 128 color palettes based on artwork from the worlds greatest artists.</description>

      <description>Intro In 2016, Garrett Grolemond gave a talk at the very first Shiny Developer Conference in Palo Alto, California. The first slide in his presentation read in big bold letters, “Writing Big Apps, How to use Shiny Modules”. You can find the slides here and a video of the talk here.
In a nutshell, shiny modules allow users to write composable shiny code. Little bite size pieces of code that can be reused and brought together to work as a whole.</description>

This post is essentially an extension of a previous post I wrote. The only addition is a cool idea for testing near equality of outputs. I’m calling this an “equality matrix”, a matrix of methods that displays whether or not they are equal to each other. One use case is benchmarking. As we benchmark multiple solutions to a single problem, testing whether or not the outputs are equal becomes more time consuming as the all.</description>

      <description>Welcome to SO. In order to answer your question, please provide a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.
 If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever asked a question on Stack Overflow (SO), you may recognize the quote above. This is because reproducibility is incredibly important when asking programming questions and it&amp;rsquo;s often overlooked. To be brief, a great reproducible example should be:
 Minimal &amp;ndash; Provide the least amount of code needed to reproduce the problem.</description>
