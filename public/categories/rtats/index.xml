      <description>Thanks, your package is on its way to CRAN.
 Introduction I am really excited to announce (12 days late) that lisa is on CRAN, my first R package available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network! This was a pretty big deal for me because I have wanted to submit something to CRAN for a couple of years now.
Anyway, lisa is a color palette pacakge, it provides R users with 128 color palettes based on artwork from the worlds greatest artists.</description>
