      <description>“Welcome to SO. In order to answer your question, please provide a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.”
 If you’ve ever asked a question on Stack Overflow (SO), you may recognize the quote above. This is because reproducibility is incredibly important when asking programming questions and it’s often overlooked by newcombers. To be brief, a great reproducible example should be:
Minimal – Provide the least amount of code needed to reproduce the problem.</description>

      <description>I am currently a contractor working with the Apple Maps team. Grew up in Oregon where I received my geography degree from the University of Oregon. I am interested in spatial data analysis and collection. I am also a big R useR and spend a lot of time using this tool for summary statistics, plotting, data munging, and more.
In my free time, I drink a lot of coffee, watch movies, and participate in social programming (Stack Overflow).</description>
