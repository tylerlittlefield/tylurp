This blog uses [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [hugo-tanka](https://github.com/road2stat/hugo-tanka), and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

1. blogdown: Creates blogs/websites in R with R Markdown
2. hugo-tanka: A minimal hugo/blogdown theme
3. netlify: Deployment, continuous integration and more for blog

There are two modifications made to the theme, they are:

1. Uses font awesome icons for the header instead of text, currently configurable in `config.toml`. For example:
```toml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "fa fa-github"
    url = "https://github.com/tylurp"
    weight = 1
```

2. Uses a different code highlight theme using highlight.js, currently not configurable in `config.toml` but can be modified in `header.html`, see [this](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2017/11/15/syntax-highlighting/) post for more information.
