My name is Tyler Littlefield. I typically write about R programming here. If I'm feeling adventurous I may write something unrelated to R. 

I consider myself a hobbyist programmer because I don't have any formal training or educational background yet I find programming to be entertaining and I get immense satisfaction from doing it. 

In college, most of my work involved spatial data problems using point and click GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS. Towards the end of my senior year I took a class on geographic data science using R and found this language to be very intuitive for reasons that are beyond me. Maybe one day I'll understand but for now, I write.
