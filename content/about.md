I am currently working with the ArborPro team, a software company that designs tree inventory software for arborists. I grew up in Oregon but have been living in California since 2016. I am interested in spatial data and rstats.

In my free time I drink a lot of coffee, watch movies, and participate in social programming.

Shoot me an [email](mailto:tylurp1@gmail.com) if you have any questions or just want to say hi!
