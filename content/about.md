I am currently a contractor working with the Apple Maps team. Grew up in Oregon where I received my geography degree from the University of Oregon. I am interested in spatial data analysis and collection. I am also a big R useR.

In my free time, I drink a lot of coffee, watch movies, and participate in social programming.

Shoot me an [email](mailto:tylurp1@gmail.com) if you have any questions or just want to say hi!
