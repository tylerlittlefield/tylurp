<p>If you’ve ever asked a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> (SO), you may recognize the quote above. This is because reproducibility is incredibly important when asking programming questions and it’s often overlooked by newcombers. To be brief, a great reproducible example should be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Minimal</strong> – Provide the least amount of code needed to reproduce the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> – Provide everything needed to reproduce the problem (pacakges, data, functions, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Verifiable</strong> – Test your code and confirm that it reproduces the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">this SO post</a> for a comprehensive defintion of what constitutes a minimal, complete, and verifiable example. For discussion on reproducibility in R, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example">this SO post</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, here’s a list of some other things I think are important:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Load the packages you need. Don’t ask/answer questions with <code>library(tidyverse)</code> when the user only needs <code>dplyr</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid text heavy questions. Questions are often easier to answer with just a few sentences, data, and the desired output.</li>
<li>Ask one question at a time. If you have another, post a different question rather than modifying the original.</li>
<li>Use <code>dput</code> to copy/paste data and <code>reprex</code> for rendering your code.</li>
<li>Avoid fragile and destructive code like <code>setwd()</code> or <code>rm(list = ls())</code>.</li>
</ol>
